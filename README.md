### Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently focusing on:

 - `tasq` - A scalable worker pool for distributed tasks in golang.

My Learning Roadmap for 2024:

 - `go`. [Repository](https://github.com/symonk/learning-golang)
 - `sql`. [Repository](https://github.com/symonk/learning-sql)

Penetration testing is a core hobby of mine and I enjoy finding vulnerabilities particularly in
web applications and APIs.
